# Everything Project

Everything I'm working on or have half-complete, all in a single project.

## Getting Started

You should be able to run 'make' and get some executables out.

## Prerequisites

Windows:

* GCC (mingw32 recommended)

Linux:

* X11 libraries

## Installing

TODO - Nothing yet

## Running the Tests

Unit tests are self-contained executables named test\_XXX.

## Coding Style

* Files from other projects keep their original style.
* New files should follow a [BSD kernel normal form](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9).
* Except where I have deviated. Unless I've made a mistake.

## Contributing

Send diff through email or a github pull request, either will do.
